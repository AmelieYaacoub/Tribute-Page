# Tribute-Page

**Tribute-Page by Amélie Yaacoub | [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Project | February 2020**

I started to teach myself more about the frameworks, programming languages and front-end applications.
For this I use free online tutorials like Free Code Camp and share my results on GitHub.

I have always been curious and very self-organized and love to teach myself new things. I am convinced that it is never too late to start something new! :)

So I tried out the Free Code Camp Challenges..

## The Challenge
The Responsive Web Design Certification from Free Code Camp includes five final projects to apply the learned skills.
### Project One
On the [first project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page) you have to build a Tribute-Page for something or someone you like, but it should be functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).

### What is my Tribute-Page about?
I have dedicated my Tribute-Page to the unique and wonderful [Amália Rodrigues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A1lia_Rodrigues).

## Learned Skills

My Tribute-Page includes:

- HTML
- CSS
